# 🚀 AI Career Path Simulator 

## 📌 Overview

AI Career Path Simulator is an intelligent machine learning web app that predicts the most suitable career roles for a candidate based on their skills, experience level, and interests.

Unlike basic job recommendation systems, this project uses **semantic NLP embeddings + similarity scoring** to match user profiles with real-world career paths.

This simulates how modern HR-tech and recruitment AI platforms evaluate candidates.
